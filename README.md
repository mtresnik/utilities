# Utilities


A novel package for functional and symbolic math, graphing, and image processing in Java.
-

This utilities package is split into:

- Math (using symbolic logic)
- Images (and common operations on images)
- Arrays and reflection

The Math sub-package:

- Use complex numbers in regular operations
- Take derivatives generally
- Graph all math functions using symbolic logic
- Define math functions using lambda expressions
- Perform simple matrix functions
- Perform polynomial regression and interpolation
- Evaluate fitness of regression models
- Supports sigma summations, products, trigonometric functions, negations
- Supports different user-defined variables
- Plug in for different variables
- Parses strings to their polynomial counterpart
- Extends to vector functions

The Images sub-package:

- Loading images of different extensions
- Adding, erroding, opening, and closing operations
- Sobel operations
- Slant operations
- Greyscale conversions
- Splitting images based on ranges and offsets
- Resizing images (nearest neighbor)
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- Loading Gifs into arrays of images
- Saving images from byte or int arrays

The Arrays and Reflection sub-package:

- Uses reflection techniques on arrays
- Allows for lambda expressions to be used on arrays
- Serialization of objects to their byte array counterpart
- Deserializes data from byte arrays to objects
- Casting numbers from different subclasses of Java's Number class
- Loading and saving files based on data passed and the file name
