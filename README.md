# com.resnik.util


A novel catch-all utilities package for Java.
-

This utilities package is split into:

*\*Subject to Change*

- audio *
	- For generating MIDI and doing Fourier transforms
- files
	- json
	- xml
	- kml object creation
- geo 
	- different geographic utilities
- images 
	- common operations on images
- interfaces 
	- common expected interfaces
- math 
	- uses symbolic logic, supports complex numbers
- objects *
	- arrays, reflections, general use objects
- text
	- analyzing word-count, and word similarity 

The Math sub-package:

- Use complex numbers in regular operations
- Take derivatives generally
- Graph all math functions using symbolic logic
- Define math functions using lambda expressions
- Perform simple matrix functions
- Perform polynomial regression and interpolation
- Evaluate fitness of regression models
- Supports sigma summations, products, trigonometric functions, negations
- Supports different user-defined variables
- Plug in for different variables
- Parses strings to their polynomial counterpart
- Extends to vector functions

The Images sub-package:

- Loading images of different extensions
- Adding, erroding, opening, and closing operations
- Sobel operations
- Slant operations
- Greyscale conversions
- Splitting images based on ranges and offsets
- Resizing images (nearest neighbor)
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- Loading Gifs into arrays of images
- Saving images from byte or int arrays

The Objects sub-package:

- Uses reflection techniques on arrays
- Allows for lambda expressions to be used on arrays
- Serialization of objects to their byte array counterpart
- Deserializes data from byte arrays to objects
- Casting numbers from different subclasses of Java's Number class
- Loading and saving files based on data passed and the file name
